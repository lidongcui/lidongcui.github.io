*Abstract*:
This study examines how the accounting line items reported on the income statement influence earnings management through classification shifting. Using data from the 2003-2023 period, we find that more accounting line items reported on the income statement help mitigate classification shifting. We also document that more comparable income line items among peer firms in the same industry further mitigate classification shifting.

*Abstract*:
Prior research provides evidence that greater financial reporting transparency facilitates the detection of earnings management by financial statement users. This increased risk of detection should reduce the level of earnings management. We test this conjecture by analyzing the association between income statement format and earnings management. The FASB and the IASB have jointly issued several exposure drafts and conceptual frameworks to advocate for more cohesive and transparent financial statement presentation (2010, 2021, and 2023). Our findings provide direct evidence of how income statement presentation may affect the level of earnings management.
